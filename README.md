# Year_2_Alpha
a collection of scripts to process and analyse magnetometer data.

## Data Colection and Validation

Under this section we will automatically pull the data from the uni server and save a local copy. Once we have a local copy we will 
we will run some basic validation and cleaning of the data, making notes of any data sets that are incongruous, before saving the valid data.

## Data Normaliazation and conversation.

In this section we will run the various conversions to take the raw magnotomater data and turn it into a standard time series of si values. this
will include normalising for temparetue and doing any noise reduction.


## Data Analisis and graphing.

In this section we will take out data sets and do comparisons and and data cleaning for preparing output graphs.


## The Python envirement.

For this project we will use a python 3.6 virtual enviroment that will be provisioned and discaraded after every run, this will allow maximun repeatablility and portability. 

## Running the Analisis

to run the analisis you simply need to run "./run" in the root directory of the project.
